     When it comes to getting started in the coding world,
      most people choose to start with the most basic methods, HTML and CSS. 
      As a result, when it comes to developing a unique application or website,
      you can make only static web pages because of thinking outside the box to
      stand out from the crowd of other developers who are also learning the same skills.
      In this manner, you may come up with innovative HTML projects!
